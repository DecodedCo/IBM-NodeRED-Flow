# IBM-NodeRED-Flow (THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE, HAMBURG)

This repository contains the JSON code to replicate the flow that we use within the IBM CbD sessions.

There is also a boilerplate JS file that can be used to bring data into the dashboard app from the Node-Red API.

If you do not have a working sensor you can test this using the simulator device ID which can be found here -> https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/iotsensor/
